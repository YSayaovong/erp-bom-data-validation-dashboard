# ERP BOM Data Validation & Release Analytics Dashboard (Simulated)

## Overview

This project simulates an ERP-based Bill of Materials (BOM) validation and revision control analysis process within a manufacturing release environment.

The objective is to demonstrate how structured product data discrepancies can be tracked, analyzed, and visualized to support operational decision-making and master data governance.

All data in this project is fully simulated for privacy and does not represent any real company systems or products.

## Business Context

In manufacturing environments, incorrect revisions, hierarchy issues, or missing parts within multi-level BOM structures can lead to:

- Production delays  
- Rework  
- Scrap cost  
- ERP data inconsistencies  

This project models how a Data or Business Analyst can monitor structured ERP data to identify recurring configuration errors and improve release accuracy.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
- Formula-driven KPI modeling  
- COUNTIF / COUNTIFS aggregation  
- Date-based trend grouping  
- Native Excel charts  
- Structured data validation logic  

All charts are dynamically driven by formulas. No static images were used.

## Key Features

### KPI Dashboard
- Total BOM Errors  
- Rework Rate (%)  
- Average Resolution Time (hrs)  
- Total Estimated Cost Impact ($)  

### Error Analysis
- Error type distribution  
- Detection stage breakdown  
- Monthly error trend tracking  

### Revision Change Log Simulation
- Structured revision updates  
- Change reason tracking  
- Rework impact modeling  

---

## Analytical Approach

The dashboard uses:

- COUNTIF and COUNTIFS for categorical aggregation  
- Date range logic for monthly trend calculation  
- Formula-driven KPI summarization  
- Structured error classification modeling  

The project simulates how ERP master data discrepancies can be quantified and tied to operational impact.

## What This Demonstrates

- ERP master data awareness  
- Structured product data validation  
- Operational analytics mindset  
- Business impact framing  
- Entry-level Data / Business Systems Analyst capability
